						<p>Howdy!</p><p>My name is Jorge Farinacci and I was born in Panama during the July of 1998, while my father was stationed there. Shortly after my birth we PCSed to Puerto Rico where my family is from, and where I spent the early years of my life prior to the army sending us state side when I was 4. Which just so happens to be where all the meories I have of my youth actually began.</p>
						<p> First duty station state side after I was born was in Savanah, Georgia where I began school and learned to play baseball and basketabll. Fun fact Savanah was one of the only major confederate cities that General Sherman didnt torch on his famous march to the sea.</p>
					<p>Following Georgia we PCSed to Texas for the first time. Despite its incredibly humid summers it was the state with the lowest cost of living we had ever seen, along side some of the friendliest most welcoming people where my parents decided, they would like to retire upon completeing their remaining years of service.</p>
					<p> After Texas for our next duty station came Germany where I completed 7th, 8th and half of my 9th grade year, throughout which I got to travel alot with school and with my family. Unforuntately in my second year there word came that President Obama was having many bases closed across Europe so people needed to start packing up and moving. Our choices included Buamholder, Germany or go back to the states. When it came to being stuck at Baumholder also known as "the rock" or going back to the states, the choice became easy and we headed back.</p>
					<p>Arriving back stateside in October of 2012, we spent 6 month in Virginia while my father completeed CCC, and then moved back to Texas where my father would eventually retire before the start of my senior year of high school in 2015.</p>During my senior year of HS I applied to general engineering at Texas A&M and was offered to go to Galveston campus or College Station campus, and I opted for the former and had a pleasent year living on the beach before general engineering ended and I had to apply to a college and move up to College Station. Now I am in my senior year of Computer Science, just waiting peacefully to see what comes next.
